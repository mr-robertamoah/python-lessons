# Python Lessons — Complete Programming and Data Analysis Course

This repository contains a comprehensive 24-lesson course designed to teach complete beginners programming using Python, with a focus on data analysis. The course is structured for one-on-one instruction where the instructor uses Docker on Ubuntu and the student uses Python installed on Windows 11.

## Course Structure

- `setup/` — Setup instructions for both instructor (Docker) and student (Windows 11 + Git)
- `lessons/` — 24 numbered lesson folders (00-23), each containing:
  - `lesson.md` — Detailed concept explanations and demonstrations
  - `examples/` — Runnable code examples
  - `exercises.md` — Guided and independent practice exercises
  - `solutions/` — Complete solutions for all exercises
- `course-toc.md` — Detailed table of contents with learning objectives

## Prerequisites

- Student: Windows 11 computer
- Instructor: Ubuntu with Docker
- No prior programming experience required

## Getting Started

1. **Students**: Follow `setup/STUDENT-WINDOWS-11.md` to install Python and Git
2. **Instructors**: Follow `setup/INSTRUCTOR-DOCKER.md` to set up Docker environment
3. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
4. Start with Lesson 00 (Git and GitHub setup)

## Course Progression

The course is designed for 60-90 minute sessions, progressing from absolute beginner to intermediate Python with data analysis capabilities. The 24 lessons are organized into 5 phases:

1. **Programming Fundamentals** (Lessons 00-09): Core Python concepts
2. **Development Environment** (Lesson 10): Tools and environment setup
3. **Data Analysis Fundamentals** (Lessons 11-15): NumPy, Pandas, visualization
4. **Advanced Data Analysis** (Lessons 16-21): ML, pipelines, optimization
5. **Capstone and Portfolio** (Lessons 22-23): Projects and career preparation

Each lesson builds on previous concepts while introducing new skills needed for data analysis.

## Teaching Approach

- **Concept Introduction**: Each lesson starts with clear explanations
- **Live Demonstrations**: Instructor shows examples in real-time
- **Guided Practice**: Student works through exercises with instructor support
- **Independent Practice**: Student completes additional exercises solo
- **Solutions Review**: Discuss approaches and best practices
