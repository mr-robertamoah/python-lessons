# Lesson 00 Solutions: Git and GitHub Setup

## Exercise Solutions and Expected Outcomes

### Exercise 1: Installation Verification

**Expected Commands and Output**:
```bash
# Check Git version
git --version

### Exercise 2: Repository Creation

**GitHub Repository Settings**:
- Repository name: `python-learning-exercises`
- Visibility: Public
- Initialize with README: ✓

**Local Setup Commands**:
```bash
# Navigate to desired location
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
mkdir PythonLearning
cd PythonLearning

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-learning-exercises.git
cd python-learning-exercises

dir  # Should show README.md
```

---

### Exercise 3: First Commit

**File Content** (`about-me.md`):
```markdown
# About Me

**Name**: [Student's Name]
**Goal**: Learn Python for data analysis
**Experience**: Complete beginner
**Date Started**: [Current Date]
```

**Git Commands**:
```bash
# Create and edit file (content above)
# Then:
git add about-me.md
git commit -m "Add about me file"
git push
```

**Verification**: File should appear on GitHub repository page

---

### Exercise 4: Create Lesson Folders

**Commands**:
```bash
# Create directories
mkdir lesson-01-intro-programming
mkdir lesson-02-python-basics
mkdir lesson-03-control-flow
mkdir lesson-04-functions
mkdir lesson-05-data-structures

# Create notes files
echo "# Lesson 1 Notes" > lesson-01-intro-programming/notes.md
echo "# Lesson 2 Notes" > lesson-02-python-basics/notes.md
echo "# Lesson 3 Notes" > lesson-03-control-flow/notes.md
echo "# Lesson 4 Notes" > lesson-04-functions/notes.md
echo "# Lesson 5 Notes" > lesson-05-data-structures/notes.md

# Add all and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Set up lesson folders"
git push
```

**Expected Structure**:
```
python-learning-exercises/
├── README.md
├── about-me.md
├── lesson-01-intro-programming/
│   └── notes.md
├── lesson-02-python-basics/
│   └── notes.md
├── lesson-03-control-flow/
│   └── notes.md
├── lesson-04-functions/
│   └── notes.md
└── lesson-05-data-structures/
    └── notes.md
```

### Exercise 5: Git Status and Diff

**Updated `about-me.md`**:
```markdown
# About Me

**Name**: [Student's Name]
**Goal**: Learn Python for data analysis
**Experience**: Complete beginner
**Date Started**: [Current Date]
**Favorite Programming Concept So Far**: Version control with Git!
```

**Commands and Expected Output**:
```bash
# Check status
git status
# Output: 
# On branch main
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   modified:   about-me.md

# Check differences
git diff
# Output: Shows the added line with + prefix

# Add, commit, push
git add about-me.md
git commit -m "Add favorite programming concept"
git push
```

---

### Exercise 6: Git History

**Commands**:
```bash
# View commit history
git log --oneline
# Output: List of commits with short hashes and messages

git log --graph --oneline
# Output: Visual representation of commit history
```

**Sample `git-commands.md`**:
```markdown
# Essential Git Commands

1. **git status** - Check what files have changed
2. **git add .** - Stage all changes for commit
3. **git commit -m "message"** - Save changes with a description
4. **git push** - Upload changes to GitHub
5. **git pull** - Download latest changes from GitHub

## Most Useful Command
I think `git status` will be most useful because it helps me understand what's happening before I commit changes.
```

### Challenge 2: Repository Observations

**Sample `repository-observations.md`**:
```markdown
# Repository Observations

## What I Noticed

### Python CPython Repository
- Very organized folder structure
- Detailed README with contribution guidelines
- Lots of documentation files
- Code is well-commented

### Pandas Repository

### Challenge 3: Git Branching

**Commands**:
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b experiment

# Make changes to any file
echo "This is an experiment" > experiment.txt

# Commit changes
git add experiment.txt
git commit -m "Add experiment file"

# Switch back to main
git checkout main
# Note: experiment.txt is not visible

# Switch back to experiment
git checkout experiment
# Note: experiment.txt is back

# Optional: merge experiment into main
git checkout main
git merge experiment
```

## Common Mistakes and Solutions

### Mistake 1: Forgetting to Save Files
**Problem**: Made changes but `git status` shows nothing
**Solution**: Save your files in the text editor before using Git commands

### Mistake 2: Committing Without Adding
**Problem**: `git commit` says "nothing to commit"
**Solution**: Use `git add .` or `git add filename` before committing

### Mistake 3: Unclear Commit Messages
**Problem**: Using messages like "changes" or "update"
**Solution**: Be specific: "Add about me information" or "Create lesson folder structure"

### Mistake 4: Working in Wrong Directory
**Problem**: Git commands not working
**Solution**: Use `cd` to navigate to your repository folder first

## Instructor Notes

### Key Points to Emphasize
1. Git is a skill they'll use throughout their programming career
2. The basic workflow (add, commit, push) will become automatic with practice
3. It's okay to make mistakes - Git helps you recover from them
4. Focus on the essential commands first, advanced features come later

### Common Student Struggles
- Understanding the difference between Git and GitHub
- Remembering to save files before Git operations
- Writing meaningful commit messages
- Navigating directories in Command Prompt

### Assessment Criteria
- Can successfully create and clone repositories
- Understands basic Git workflow
- Can troubleshoot simple Git issues
- Demonstrates good commit message practices
