# Lesson 19 Exercises: Performance Optimization

## Guided Exercises (Do with Instructor)

### Exercise 1: Profiling and Benchmarking
**Goal**: Identify performance bottlenecks

**Tasks**:
1. Use cProfile to profile code
2. Analyze timing with timeit
3. Memory profiling with memory_profiler
4. Identify optimization opportunities

```python
import cProfile
import timeit
from memory_profiler import profile

def slow_function():
    # Code to profile
    pass

# Profile the function
cProfile.run('slow_function()')

# Benchmark with timeit
time_taken = timeit.timeit(slow_function, number=1000)
```

### Exercise 2: Algorithm Optimization
**Goal**: Improve algorithmic efficiency

**Tasks**:
1. Compare O(nÂ²) vs O(n log n) sorting
2. Optimize search algorithms
3. Use appropriate data structures
4. Implement caching strategies

```python
def inefficient_search(data, target):
    # O(n) linear search
    pass

def efficient_search(data, target):
    # O(log n) binary search
    pass
```
